During my time as a Software Engineer in a research group at the Engineering School in Seville, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects across multiple domains. These projects span areas such as data science, firmware programming, and the development of modern web applications, allowing me to continuously expand my technical expertise and adapt to diverse problem spaces. Collaborating with researchers and engineers, I contributed both to experimental proof-of-concept initiatives and to production-ready solutions that integrated advanced technologies.

In the field of embedded systems and firmware development, I worked extensively with C/C++, STM32 microcontrollers, FreeRTOS, and real-time operating systems, designing efficient and reliable solutions for hardware-focused projects. My experience also covered hardware integration using communication protocols like I2C, UART, CANBUS, and LoRa, alongside development environments such as IAR and Ozone. Complementary to this, I leveraged Altium for PCB-related tasks and Autodesk Inventor for mechanical design considerations, ensuring a holistic approach to embedded engineering challenges.

On the data science side, I engaged in projects requiring the application of Pythonâ€™s scientific stack, including Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to analyze and visualize data for research-driven insights. Some initiatives also involved MATLAB for algorithm prototyping and simulations, where I combined mathematical modeling with practical implementations. This dual exposure to theory and real-world application allowed me to translate research findings into actionable engineering solutions.

Additionally, I participated in the development of web applications, where I applied modern frameworks such as ReactJS, NestJS, and NodeJS, along with TypeScript and MongoDB, to build scalable and user-friendly platforms. These projects emphasized clean architecture, maintainability, and seamless user experience, often serving as interfaces for interacting with data-driven systems or embedded solutions. Throughout all endeavors, version control tools like Git, GitHub, and GitKraken were integral for ensuring smooth collaboration and code management across teams.

Overall, my role enabled me to contribute to multidisciplinary projects, combining software, hardware, and research perspectives. This diverse background not only strengthened my technical versatility but also enhanced my ability to adapt quickly, collaborate effectively, and deliver results in dynamic engineering environments.
