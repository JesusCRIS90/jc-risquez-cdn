During this stage I had the opportunity to learn about different engineering fields. Naming several which I think are the quite important and most impact me are:

* Wireless Sensor Networks: IoT, 802.15.4, ZigBee, 6LowPAN, Routing, Contiki, Cooja, Zolertia Z1
* Automation projects: CoDeSyS, ST, SFC, LD languages, Modicon M340, Unity Pro XL, Technical and Safety Reports, GEMMA Guide
* Robotics: robotics project reporting, knowledge of ROS.
* Processor systems: CPU parallels and risks, MIPS architecture, Pipeline, Superscalars, Memory hierarchy, Cache. Project: Facial recognition access control using Raspberry Pi, Python, SenseHat and PiCamera.
* Logic systems: FPGAs, design, verification. Using Xilinx ISE with VHDL.
* Perceptual Systems: Kalman Filter, Optical Flow, K-Means, Classification, ANN, Self-Location.
* Vehicle Control: Matlab/Simulink, ABS, Cruise Control/ ACC, Stability Control (ESP), Hybrid Vehicles, QSS
* Control in Distribution Systems: Kalman Filter, Recursive Least Squares, MPC
