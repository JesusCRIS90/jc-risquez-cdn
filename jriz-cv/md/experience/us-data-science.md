The project focused on evaluating the viability of electric buses within the city. It was a collaborative effort involving TUSSAM (Seville's public transport company) and Évolution Synergétique. My primary responsibilities in this project included: 

 * Data Preparation: Analyzing, selecting, cleaning, and unifying the various data provided by TUSSAM. 
 * Data Generation: Developing algorithms to create new synthetic data based on the original data. 
 * Simulation Tool: Developing software to configure and execute multiple simulations. 
 * Final Analysis: Analyzing all results to assess the project’s viability. 

As a result of this project, TUSSAM gained an accurate understanding of battery lifespan under urban traffic conditions, enabling them to determine which routes are most suitable for the introduction of electric buses. Additionally, a comprehensive paper detailing the entire process was published.
