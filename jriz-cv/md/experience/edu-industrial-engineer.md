I earned my Bachelor’s Degree in Engineering with a focus on Electronics and Industrial Automation, where I discovered my passion for blending theory with hands-on creation. From designing circuits and exploring control systems to diving into robotics and firmware programming, my studies gave me the chance to work across a wide range of exciting fields. I particularly enjoyed bringing ideas to life through CAD design, programming, and mechanical design projects, which allowed me to combine creativity with technical precision.

Along the way, I built strong skills in C, C++, Python, MATLAB, and Simulink, using them to solve complex problems, model real-world systems, and push the limits of what I could automate or simulate. For me, engineering isn’t just about solving problems—it’s about building smarter, more efficient solutions and constantly learning how technology can be used to improve the way we work and live.
