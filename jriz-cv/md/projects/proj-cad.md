This project is a curated collection of CAD models and design exercises developed throughout my formation process, showcasing a strong foundation in 3D modeling, mechanical design, and product development. Each piece reflects not only technical proficiency but also the ability to approach engineering challenges with creativity and precision. The collection includes a variety of projects ranging from conceptual designs to detailed assemblies, highlighting my growth as a designer and engineer.

The work was created using industry-standard tools such as SolidWorks, CATIA V5, and Autodesk Inventor, allowing me to gain hands-on experience with different CAD environments and workflows. This diversity demonstrates adaptability and a solid understanding of parametric modeling, design optimization, and documentation practices. Altogether, this portfolio of CAD projects represents both my learning journey and my readiness to contribute effectively to real-world engineering and product design tasks.
