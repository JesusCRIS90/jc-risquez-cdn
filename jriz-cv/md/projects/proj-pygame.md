This project is a collection of Python-based games developed using Pygame, created as part of my journey to explore the world of game development. Each game reflects my curiosity and passion for understanding how games are structured, designed, and brought to life through programming. From simple mechanics to slightly more complex logic, these projects highlight my ability to translate ideas into interactive experiences.

Beyond just creating games, this project served as a practical way to strengthen my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming in Python. By working on multiple small projects, I was able to apply core programming concepts repeatedly in different contexts, which deepened my understanding. Most of these games were developed by following online resources such as Udemy and YouTube courses, and then expanding on them with my own touches. This collection not only showcases my technical growth but also my enthusiasm for continuous learning and creativity in software development.
