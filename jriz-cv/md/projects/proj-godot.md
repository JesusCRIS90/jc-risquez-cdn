This project is a collection of games developed using the Godot engine, each designed as a way to explore and experiment with different aspects of game development. Ranging from simple mechanics to more structured gameplay experiences, the collection represents both a hands-on learning process and a creative outlet. The games were built to satisfy my curiosity about how games function at their core—from handling player movement and interactions to implementing UI elements and scene transitions.

Many of the projects were created while following along with a structured Udemy course, which provided foundational knowledge and practical exercises. At the same time, I added my own personal touches and tweaks to expand on what was taught, ensuring I gained a deeper understanding of the engine’s capabilities. This collection reflects both my technical growth in Godot and my passion for experimenting with game design concepts.
