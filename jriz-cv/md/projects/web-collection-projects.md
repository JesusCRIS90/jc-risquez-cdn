This project is a collection of experimental web pages created as part of my journey to strengthen my expertise in Angular while bridging knowledge from other technologies like React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal was to use practical, hands-on development to translate concepts I already understood in React and vanilla web technologies into the Angular ecosystem, helping me grasp how Angular structures, components, and lifecycles work differently.

Beyond serving as a personal learning ground, these pages became a testing environment for my own custom libraries, branded under @beexy. Here, I explored how to build and integrate Angular directives, gaining deeper insights into creating reusable, framework-friendly utilities that extend Angularâ€™s functionality. This experimentation also laid the groundwork for more robust libraries I plan to release in the future.

Another key aspect of this project was experimenting with development workflows. I set up and worked with Verdaccio, a lightweight private NPM registry, to simulate real-world publishing and deployment scenarios. Using Docker, I deployed Verdaccio locally, which allowed me to safely publish, manage, and test my custom packages in a controlled environment before pushing them into a public ecosystem.

In essence, this project is more than just a collection of web pagesâ€”it represents a practical playground where I combined learning, experimentation, and prototyping. By exploring Angularâ€™s ecosystem through translation, library testing, and registry management, I built a stronger foundation in frontend engineering while preparing for future development of custom tools and libraries.
